title: "I Think Some Hackers Installed Some Viruses on My PC!"
---
Baby Boomers really are the worst people on the planet. Their complete inability to comprehend technology is eclipsed only by their unwillingness (I am talking about Baby Boomers from India) to comprehend it.

Not long ago I was asked to help a Baby Boomer fix their PC. The exchange I had can only be described as brain seizure inducing.

BB: "Thambi en computer romba slow-vaa irku, edhavadhu panni seri padthu / Kid "
Me: Okay

Me: "Uncle unga computer la nariya virus malaware irku / You have a lot of viruses and malaware on your PC"
BB: "Na idha pathi paper la padichen, China lendhu hackers Indiyava target pannara, yedhavadhu hacker dhaan poturpan / I read in the papers that Chinese hackers are waging a cyber war against India. It must be one of those guys"

Yes, Chinese hackers realize the immense gains to be had targetting veshti wearing, filter coffee drinking retired insurance agents and not something useless like RAW or the NIA.

BB: "Haha romba thanks da thambi, idhukaaga dhaan oru oru veetuliyam oru computer science padichavan theva / Thanks a lot kid, this is why every house should have CS grad."

Me: "Na paathukaren uncle, time varcha paathukalam / I'll handle that when the time comes"
BB: "Yen da, uncle innum great demand theriyuma??

Whenever I go to carnaticmusicsongsmp3.com I keep getting messages that Hot singles in my area are waiting to meet me"
Me: "*disbelief brain seizure starts*"

People like this are the reason Nigerian prince scams work.
