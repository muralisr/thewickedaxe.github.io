        <title>I Think Some Hackers Installed Some Viruses on My PC!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Baby Boomers really are the worst people on the planet. Their complete inability to comprehend technology is eclipsed only by their unwillingness (I am talking about Baby Boomers from India) to comprehend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago I was asked to help a Baby Boomer fix their PC. The exchange I had can only be described as brain seizure inducing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-algol&quot; data-lang=&quot;algol&quot;&gt;* English translation for those of you who do not speak Tamil *
Me: *Strolls in*
BB: &quot;Thambi en computer romba slow-vaa irku, edhavadhu panni seri padthu / Kid &quot;
Me: Okay
...
...
Me: &quot;Uncle unga computer la nariya virus malaware irku / You have a lot of viruses and malaware on your PC&quot;
BB: &quot;Na idha pathi paper la padichen, China lendhu hackers Indiyava target pannara, yedhavadhu hacker dhaan poturpan / I read in the papers that Chinese hackers are waging a cyber war against India. It must be one of those guys&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Chinese hackers realize the immense gains to be had targetting veshti wearing, filter coffee drinking retired insurance agents and not something useless like RAW or the NIA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-algol&quot; data-lang=&quot;algol&quot;&gt;Me: &quot;Uncle ennaku adha pathi theriyadhu but neenga unga browsing habits konjam maathanum / I don&#39;t know about that, but you need to change your browsing habits a bit&quot;
BB: &quot;Thambi ennaku adhu ellam theiryadhu, yedho panni en computer fix pannu / Kid I don&#39;t know anything about all that fix my comouter&quot;
....
*post nuking large portions of the filesystem*
Me: &quot;Uncle unga computer la na antivurus install pannirken, inime konjam safe-aa browse pannunga / I&#39;ve installed some antivirus on your PC, please brose safer from now on&quot;
BB: &quot;Haha romba thanks da thambi, idhukaaga dhaan oru oru veetuliyam oru computer science padichavan theva / Thanks a lot kid, this is why every house should have CS grad.&quot;
BB: &quot;Aana romba padikaadhe, haha, indha age la dhaan nee future ku settle down plans ku ellam foundations podanaum *wink wink*. Doubts irundha uncle kitta kelu / But don&#39;t study too hard, this is the age you should lay the foundations for settling down later, *wink wink* ask me how&quot;
Me: &quot;Na paathukaren uncle, time varcha paathukalam / I&#39;ll handle that when the time comes&quot;
BB: &quot;Yen da, uncle innum great demand theriyuma?? Ennaku ippo kuda carnaticsongsmp3.com ku ponena Hot singles in your area are waiting to meet you nu message vandhute irukum! / You know I&#39;m still in great demand. Whenever I go to carnaticmusicsongsmp3.com I keep getting messages that Hot singles in my area are waiting to meet me&quot;
Me: &quot;*disbelief brain seizure starts*&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like this are the reason Nigerian prince scams work.&lt;/p&gt;
